3. Finding "Toggle Scoreboard"
4. Setting their preferred key

## Configuration

### Server Name
To change the server name displayed on the scoreboard:
1. Open `html/index.html`
2. Find line: `<span>Server: YourServerName</span>`
3. Replace "YourServerName" with your server's name

### Styling
The scoreboard's appearance can be customized by editing the CSS in `html/index.html`:

## Customization Examples

### Adding Player Money Display
```lua
-- In server.lua, modify the player data collection:
table.insert(playerData, {
    id = playerId,
    name = playerName,
    ping = playerPing,
    money = GetPlayerMoney(playerId) -- Your money function here
})
```

-- In client.lua, change the RegisterKeyMapping:
RegisterKeyMapping('scoreboard', 'Toggle Scoreboard', 'keyboard', 'F1')
```
